# **ðŸŽ¯ Project: Sentiment Analysis Dashboard**

# **Link ðŸ”—** : https://sentiment-analysis-dashboard-2rzkdja4wc6barszydoqqy.streamlit.app/ 

# **1. Overview**

This project is an interactive NLP-powered dashboard built with Streamlit that performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of text reviews (e.g., movie reviews, tweets, or comments).
The app classifies each text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative, visualizes the results, and allows real-time sentiment detection via user input.

The main goal is to combine Natural Language Processing (NLP) with data visualization to make sentiment analysis accessible for both technical and non-technical users.

# **2. Objectives**

Load and preprocess a dataset of text reviews.

Apply sentiment analysis using tools like VADER or TextBlob.

Classify sentiment into three categories: Positive, Neutral, Negative.

Visualize the sentiment distribution through interactive plots.

Provide real-time sentiment prediction for custom text input.

Deploy the dashboard online using Streamlit Cloud.

# **3. Tech Stack**

Languages & Libraries
Python â†’ Core programming language.

pandas / numpy â†’ Data manipulation and preprocessing.

nltk (VADER) â†’ Rule-based sentiment analysis.

TextBlob â†’ Polarity and subjectivity scoring.

matplotlib / plotly â†’ Data visualization (pie chart, bar chart).

wordcloud â†’ Generate word clouds for different sentiment classes.

transformers (Hugging Face) â†’ (Optional) Advanced transformer-based sentiment models.

Streamlit â†’ Web framework for interactive dashboards.

# **4. Dataset**

**Structure:**

Source: IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews

| review                      | sentiment |
| --------------------------- | --------- |
| "This movie was amazing..." | positive  |
| "Worst film ever..."        | negative  |

# **5. Features**

Data Upload & Cleaning
Upload CSV file or load default IMDB dataset.

Remove missing values, normalize text (optional).

Sentiment Analysis
VADER (nltk) â†’ Quick, lightweight, and good for short texts.

Optionally integrate Hugging Face models for deeper accuracy.

Visualization
Pie chart â†’ Percentage of positive, neutral, and negative reviews.

Bar chart â†’ Sentiment counts.

Word clouds â†’ Frequent words in each sentiment class.

User Interaction
Custom input box â†’ Type a sentence, get instant sentiment feedback.

Optional filter to view only Positive/Negative/Neutral comments.

# **6. Deployment**

Local Run

streamlit run streamlit_sentiment_dashboard.py

Streamlit Cloud Deployment
Run requirements.txt with all dependencies

# **7. Example Output**

Pie Chart:
Positive â†’ 60%
Neutral  â†’ 25%
Negative â†’ 15%

User Input Test:

"I absolutely loved this!" â†’ Sentiment: Positive
"This was okay, nothing special." â†’ Sentiment: Neutral
"Terrible experience, I regret watching it." â†’ Sentiment: Negative

# **8. Learning Outcomes**

Through this project, you learn:

Data preprocessing in NLP.

Applying sentiment analysis using multiple approaches.

Visualizing results interactively with Plotly & Matplotlib.

Deploying Python apps with Streamlit Cloud.

Managing dependencies with requirements.txt.
